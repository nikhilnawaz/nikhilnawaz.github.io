<h1> Food from around the world </h1><br />
    Hi everyone! I'm Nikhil, and I'm here to share my love and knowledge of food from all around the world. From the classic Italian pizza to the deliciously fluffy donuts of America, I'm here to show you the amazing range of flavors that can be found in different cultures. I also love to talk about my experiences in different restaurants, so I can help you find the best places to eat near you. Finally, I also love to share my own cooking experiments and recipes with you, so you can explore your own culinary skills. So join me on my journey of discovering the best food from all around the world!</body>
